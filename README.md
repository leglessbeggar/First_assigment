# First_assigment
For now just the interface is implemented.
It asks for color, color red plays first.
If player color red (red is MAX player), ask for move otherwise AI moves.

Hex_skeleton is just the code from the course.

Agent is just a class to create agents to play against each other in the same board. Each agent should have different specifications as stated in the assigment.
Minimax with apha beta pruning and customizable depth and random evaluation are already implemented.

An algorithm computing the distances to get the evaluation is implemented, I tried to do as close as possible to Dijkstra but is different...
By now depth 2 in a 4x4 board is playable.

Todo:   
  Transposition tables,
  
  Visualization of cutoffs, 
  
  Iterative deepening,
  
  Pygame(?),
  
  Section 3,
  
  Anything else?
